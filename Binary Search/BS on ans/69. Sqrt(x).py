        ðŸ§  Intuition:
        - We need to find the square root of x, but return only the integer part (i.e., floor of sqrt(x)).
        - Since multiplication grows rapidly, binary search can efficiently find the largest integer whose square â‰¤ x.

        âš¡ Approach:
        - Use binary search between 1 and x.
        - At each step, compute mid = (low+high)//2.
        - If mid*mid â‰¤ x â†’ this could be our answer, but maybe there's a bigger number whose square is still â‰¤ x.
          So, update ans = mid and move low = mid+1.
        - Else, mid*mid > x â†’ mid is too big, so move high = mid-1.

        âœ… In the end, ans will be the floor of sqrt(x).
