        Partition DP (Tabulation)
        ==========================

        Problem Summary:
        - Given n balloons, each with a number in nums.
        - Bursting balloon `i` gives `nums[i-1] * nums[i] * nums[i+1]` coins.
        - After a balloon is burst, its neighbors become adjacent.
        - We need to burst all balloons in an order that maximizes total coins.

        Tabulation Plan:
        - We previously defined dp[i][j] as the max coins from bursting all balloons in the range [i, j].
        - Base case: if i > j, there are no balloons to burst â‡’ dp[i][j] = 0.
        - Try every `k` in [i, j] as the last balloon to burst in that range:
            - Coins gained = nums[i-1] * nums[k] * nums[j+1]
            - Total = coins gained + dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j]
            - Take max over all possible `k`.
        - Build the dp table in increasing order of subarray size.
