        üß† Intuition:
        To make a string palindrome with the **minimum number of insertions**, 
        we want to **retain as much of its existing palindromic structure as possible**.

        So, we first compute the **Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS)** in the string.
        Once we know the LPS, the characters **not in** the LPS are the ones we need to insert
        (in mirrored positions) to make the full string a palindrome.

        üîç Observation:
        Minimum insertions required = Total length - Length of LPS

        Why?
        Because the LPS already forms a part of the palindrome, and the rest
        must be mirrored by inserting characters.
