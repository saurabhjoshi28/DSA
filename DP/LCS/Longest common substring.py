        #    not just a common sequence. So the characters must match AND be contiguous.

        # text1 = "abcdf", text2 = "abedf"
        # Common substring = "df" ‚Üí length = 2

                    # If characters do not match, we break continuity,
                    # so we reset dp[i][j] to 0 (no common substring ends here)
