        üí° Intuition:
        This problem is about finding the **minimum number of operations** 
        (insertion, deletion) to convert one string into another.

        ‚úÖ Key Insight:
        We can convert both strings into their **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** 
        by deleting characters from either side.

        So, the total number of operations = 
            (number of deletions in word1) + (number of deletions in word2)

        ‚Üí Deletions in word1 = n1 - LCS
        ‚Üí Deletions in word2 = n2 - LCS

        üîÅ Therefore, total operations = (n1 - LCS) + (n2 - LCS) = n1 + n2 - 2 * LCS
        """

        # Recursive LCS function
        def func(i, j):
            # Base case: if either pointer goes out of bounds
            if i < 0 or j < 0:
                return 0
            # If characters match, move diagonally and add 1
            if word1[i] == word2[j]:
                return 1 + func(i - 1, j - 1)
            # Else, move in both directions and take max
            return max(func(i - 1, j), func(i, j - 1))

        # Step 1: Find LCS between word1 and word2
        lcs = func(n1 - 1, n2 - 1)

        # Step 2: Use the formula: min operations = n1 + n2 - 2 * LCS
        return n1 + n2 - (2 * lcs)

# ----------------------------------------------
# üîç Example:
# word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
# LCS = "ea" ‚Üí len = 2
# Operations = 3 + 3 - 2*2 = 6 - 4 = 2
# One valid sequence: "sea" ‚Üí delete 's' ‚Üí "ea" ‚Üí insert 't' ‚Üí "eat"
# ----------------------------------------------

# ‚ùó Note: This is the recursive version. Time complexity is exponential (O(2^n)).
# ‚úÖ You can optimize it using memoization or tabulation to make it O(n^2).
